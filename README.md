# AI-KenKen-Puzzle
## AI project to solve kenken game

### Main Idea

we simply solve A randomly generated kenken board of sizes from 3x3 to 9x9 using one of three alogrithms
{backtracking,forward checking with backtracking,arc consistency with backtracking}

### steps to run the program

1.open the "AIGUIQT.exe" or run the AIGUIQT.py file
2.choose the size of the board you want to solve
3.choose one of the three algorithms to solve with
4.An empty board is generated, press "Arrow Down" key from your keyboard to show the solution
